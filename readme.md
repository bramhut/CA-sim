# TO-DO
- [x] Check input arguments											-- Alex
- [x] Check collisions and merge objects							-- Bram
- [x] Print init_config.txt                                         -- Alex
- [x] Print final_config.txt                                        -- Alex
- [x] Integrate Rebound effect										-- Bram
- [x] Add loop over time											-- Bram
- [x] Assign mass of the objects following a normal distribution	-- Bram
- [x] Calculating forces, distance and velocity						-- Bram
- [x] Creating objects in space and distributing them				-- Bram
- [x] Fix mass RNG order											-- Bram (only fixed on Linux, on windows the results are swapped somehow)
- [x] Check for collision before loop start

And after the above:
