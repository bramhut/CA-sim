# TO-DO
- [x] Check input arguments											-- Alex
- [x] Check collisions and merge objects							-- Bram
- [x] Print init_config.txt                                         -- Alex
* Collects the data after the first change of position, should be before?
- [x] Print final_config.txt                                        -- Alex
*  The file is open all the time until the last iteration, maybe fix that?
- [x] Integrate Rebound effect										-- Bram
- [x] Add loop over time											-- Bram
- [x] Assign mass of the objects following a normal distribution	-- Bram
- [x] Calculating forces, distance and velocity						-- Bram
- [x] Creating objects in space and distributing them				-- Bram
- [ ] Fix mass RNG order
- [ ] Check for collision before loop start

And after the above: 

- [x] Create structure of arrays version          --Jon
- [ ] Performance evaluations
